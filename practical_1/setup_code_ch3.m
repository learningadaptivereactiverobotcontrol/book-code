function setup_code_ch3(testFlag)
% For Windows user: you can run setup_code_ch3(1) to only test that the 
% libraries are correctly working on your computer. If you get an error, 
% you can recompile the libraries on your computer by running setup_code_ch3
%
% For MacOs and Linux, you'll need to recompile the libraries on your computer by running setup_code_ch3
% Further instructions for Mac users below. 
% These are also available in the READ_ME in the folder 'mac_setup'.

%                                  WARNING FOR MAC USERS
% If you are using a Mac, you have some complements that you need to install 
% 
% First, follow this url : https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=command%20line%20tools
% Then log in to Apple Developper (create an account if needed) and download :
% 'Command Line Tools for Xcode 14.2'
% 
% Once downloaded, open the package and follow the installation process.
% 
% Then, you have to open a terminal window at the folder matlab_exercices/lecture4-learning-control-laws. 
% For that you have to open your finder, go to the folder matlab_exercices/lecture4-learning-control-laws
% Then, right click and choose: "New terminal to folder"
% Here a terminal window will open. If you run pwd, you should see  ../matlab_exercices/lecture4-learning-control-laws. 
% 
% We use SUDO command line, that means youâ€˜ll have to enter you admin password. 
% 
% Then run the following command in this terminal:
% bash Mac_config.sh
%
% You will then need to run 'ch3_ex4_lpvDS.m' once to finalize the setup.
